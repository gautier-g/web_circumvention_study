## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This paper explores and evaluates a range of techniques used to **filter and circumvent web access**. It discusses the following filtering mechanisms and their bypass strategies:

- Web Content Filtering
- DNS Filtering
- HTTPS Proxy Filtering
- TCP/IP Filtering
- TLS SNI Filtering

It includes practical demonstrations, comparative tables, and diagrams to assess the **efficiency**, **resilience**, and **implementation complexity** of each technique.
